# ------------------------------------------- REGRESSION MODEL SELECTION -------------------------------------------

In this folder, we are going to check the performance of all the regression model on the given dataset "Data.csv".

We have made templates of all the regression models with the help of which we will check the performance of all the
regression models by implementing them on dataset one by one.

There is a metrics module in sklearn library from which we will use r2_score class.

r2_score (pronounced as r_square_score) is a method used to compare the performance of various regression models.
~ Higher the value of r2_score better is the regression model.

CONCLUSION :-
----------
For the given dataset in this folder,
The 'Random Forest Regression Model' is the best fit among all other regression models.
